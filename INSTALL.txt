Installing CatTrack
-------------------

This document assumes you know how to install a standard rails
application and only documents the features that are unique to
the CatTrack application.

Database Setup
--------------

1. Copy "config/database.example.yml" to "config/database.yml" and edit
   the database settings for production environment.
2. Run "rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production" to initialize the database
   structure and populate it with required values.
3. Run "script/console -e production" and create a user that will have
   access to the administration section of CatTrack. Simple transcript
   follows;

 > u = User.new
 > u.username = 'myusername'
 > u.password = 'mypass'
 > u.active = true
 > u.admin = true
 > u.save!

Mailer Setup
------------

1. Copy "config/local.example.rb" to "config/local.rb" and edit the mail
   settings.
2. Run "script/console -e production" so to setup system configuration defining
   who the email comes from and where error mails will be sent. This can be
   achieved via;

 > SystemSetting.create!(:name => 'mail.from', :value => 'rvm-regression@cs.anu.edu.au')
 > SystemSetting.create!(:name => 'mail.on.error', :value => 'cattrack.admin@example.com')

Web Setup
---------

1. Start the web app via

 > cd path/to/cattrack && /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/mongrel_rails start -e production -d

2. Stop the web app via

 > cd path/to/cattrack && /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/mongrel_rails stop

3. If you are not hosting cattrack at the root level of your web application
   then you will need to edit "config/local.rb" so that contains code such as

   ActionController::AbstractRequest.relative_url_root = "/cattrack"

4. To frontend it with apache the easiest approach is to set it up as pass through proxy.

Cron Setup
----------

1. Edit crontab so that stale sessions are removed every five minutes. Add a line such
   as following to crontab to do this.

 */5 * * * * cd path/to/cattrack && rake db:sessions:remove_stale RAILS_ENV=production

2. Edit crontab so that imports occur every 12 or so hours. Cron tab line follows;

 0 */12 * * * cd path/to/cattrack && ./script/runner -e production "TestRunImporter.process_incoming_test_runs(true)"
