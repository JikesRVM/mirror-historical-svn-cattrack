* Update report format so that build configuration is stored with the build-run. In the current
  setup it is impossible to store results for any test-run that had at one or build_runs fail.
* Update report format so that build target is not extracted from test_configurations because if
  all of them fail then there will be no data present.
* Update report format so that it stores the hostname that test was completed on. May also be able
  to store additional hardware information such as speed+number of CPUs or memory/disk
  speed/capacity etc.
